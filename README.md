This is probably the simplest **WO**rk Force **MANAGE**ment Softwa**R**e you can ever get. :)

The program make work schedule from 08/01/2013 with these rules in mind:

- 3 workers (Jane, Jack, Joe)
- 22 working days a month (even Satruday, Sunday)
- every third weekend is free (Friday, Saturday)
- if all the three people have to work, posssibly be that on Friday
- the remaining 6-7 freedays should be distributed evenly,
  no 5 consecutive freedays next to each other, max 2
- every day is a workday with minimum 2 people
- dec. 24, 25, 26 and jan. 1 CLOSED

You click the button and it makes the magic, as simple as that! :)

## License

Unfortunately PyQt4 comes with the stupid GPL so I had no choice, because I don't want to use PySide, it's very buggy and not very actively developed. :(
